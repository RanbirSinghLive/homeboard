# Add to iPhone Home Screen

## Quick Steps

1. **Open Safari on your iPhone** (not Chrome - Safari only!)

2. **Navigate to your app:**
   - Go to: `https://homeboard.onrender.com`
   - Or your Render URL

3. **Tap the Share button:**
   - Look for the share icon at the bottom (square with arrow pointing up)

4. **Scroll down and tap "Add to Home Screen"**

5. **Customize (optional):**
   - Edit the name if you want (default: "Departure Board")
   - The icon will show a bus emoji 🚌

6. **Tap "Add"** in the top right

7. **Done!** You'll see the app icon on your home screen

## What You Get

- ✅ App icon on home screen
- ✅ Launches in fullscreen (no Safari UI)
- ✅ Works like a native app
- ✅ Dark theme optimized
- ✅ All features work offline (cached data)

## Tips

- **Name it something short:** "Departure" or "Board" works well
- **Place it on your home screen** for quick access
- **Works offline:** Once loaded, cached data will show even without internet
- **Auto-refresh:** App refreshes every 30 seconds when open

## Troubleshooting

**"Add to Home Screen" not showing?**
- Make sure you're using Safari (not Chrome or other browsers)
- Try refreshing the page first
- Make sure you're on the main page (not a sub-page)

**Icon not showing?**
- The icon uses an emoji (🚌) - should work on all iPhones
- If it doesn't show, the app will still work

**App opens in Safari instead of fullscreen?**
- Delete the home screen icon
- Re-add it using the steps above
- Make sure you're using the latest iOS version
